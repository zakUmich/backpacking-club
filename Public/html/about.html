				<div class="subHeaderContent">
					<p>
						The club tentatively holds weekly meetings on Wednesday nights at 7pm in 1040 DANA. Any University of Michigan Student is welcome to join, see <a href="contact.html">our page on joining the club</a> for information more information. No dues or official membership is kept, and we aim to be as accessible as possible to new members and beginners. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						Not all meetings will have information relevant to a new member, and it will usually be more effective to join the email list or to contact the club rather than simply showing up for a meeting.
